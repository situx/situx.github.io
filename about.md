My name is Timo Homburg. I am a blogger and researcher in Natural Language Processing, Semantics and GIS. 

On this website I present to you my research as well as private projects I have been working on. 

Occasionally, I will also write articles about current topics I am working on or current events that I have concerned me during my life.
